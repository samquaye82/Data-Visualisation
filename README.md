# Data-Visualisation


This contains a project where I undertake data visualisations on a wine dataset. 

Do a short Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the dataset to give an idea of the kind of data we are dealing with.
  
There are some missing values in the data. I answer whether or not I would undertake imputation. If ‘yes’, then how? I outline this in the notebook.

I then create a multi-plot grid:
○ Filter the dataset to only contain “Cabernet Sauvignon”, “Pinot Noir” and “Chardonnay” wines
After using the variety column
  ○ For each of these three wine varieties, I plot a histogram plot of the “points” column.
  
● Finally I create Word Clouds of the Province and the variety of the wine.
